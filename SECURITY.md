## Supported Versions

This project uses [Bevry's automated tooling](https://github.com/bevry/boundation) to deliver the latest updates, fixes, and improvements inside the latest release while still maintaining widespread ecosystem compatibility.

No need to wait for a scheduled release, our CI publishes each successful build of the [`main` branch](https://github.com/bevry/wait/actions?query=branch%3Amain) to the `@next` [version tag](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/config#tag).

[Refer to supported ecosystem versions (`Editions` section in `README.md`).](https://github.com/bevry/date/blob/main/README.md#Editions)
